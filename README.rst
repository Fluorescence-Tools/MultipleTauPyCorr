What is multipletau_cor_tttr?
----------------

multipletau_cor_tttr is a python package for the correlation of time-tagged time-resolved single photon counting data.
It provides efficient code for the computation of correlation function using a multiple-tau scheme for the timelag.

multipletau_cor_tttr can be applied to any single photon counting data that is represented as an array of arrival times.

---------------------
How do I use the library?
---------------------

Simply import the CCF function from multipletau_cor_tttr:

from multipletau_cor_tttr.correlate import CCF
